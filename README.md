# IPL-project-optimized

## Brief description

In this project I am using the deliveries.csv dataset. Here I am optimizing the time taken to insert deliveries dataset into the database using a programmatic approach.
I am inserting 15,000 rows at a time into the table and the time taken to do the same is averaging at 9 seconds.
